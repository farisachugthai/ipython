# When making commits that are strictly formatting/style changes, add the
# commit hash here, so git blame can ignore the change.
# See docs for more details:
# https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile

# Example entries:
# <full commit hash>  # initial black-format
# <full commit hash>  # rename something internal
