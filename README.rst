===========================================
 IPython: Productive Interactive Computing
===========================================

Overview
========

Welcome to IPython.  Our full documentation is available on `ipython.readthedocs.io
<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and contains information on how to install, use, and
contribute to the project.

**IPython versions and Python Support**

Starting with IPython 7.10, IPython follows `NEP 29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_

**IPython 7.10+** requires Python version 3.6 and above.

**IPython 7.0** requires Python version 3.5 and above.

**IPython 6.x** requires Python version 3.3 and above.

**IPython 5.x LTS** is the compatible release for Python 2.7.
If you require Python 2 support, you **must** use IPython 5.x LTS. Please
update your project configurations and requirements as necessary.


The Notebook, Qt console and a number of other pieces are now parts of *Jupyter*.
See the `Jupyter installation docs <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__
if you want to use these.




Development and Instant running
===============================

You can find the latest version of the development documentation on `readthedocs
<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal::

   $ python -m IPython

Or see the `development installation docs
<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install.html#installing-the-development-version>`_
for the latest revision on read the docs.

Documentation and installation instructions for older version of IPython can be
found on the `IPython website <https://ipython.org/documentation.html>`_



IPython requires Python version 3 or above
==========================================

Starting with version 6.0, IPython does not support Python 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, or
3.2.

For a version compatible with Python 2.7, please install the 5.x LTS Long Term
Support version.
